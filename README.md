# Mario Kart Wii VR Port

> **This is a Linux/Vulkan fork** of [heurazy/mario-kart-wii-VR-port](https://github.com/heurazy/mario-kart-wii-VR-port).
> It adds a full Linux Vulkan OpenXR path that renders both eyes on Aurora's own
> Vulkan device and queue. The fixed interop bridge below is the piece that makes
> the headset picture correct; both the Windows/D3D12 and Linux/Vulkan paths use
> the same Aurora-owned device, with **no CPU texture readback** and no second
> graphics device. See [Building on Linux](#building-on-linux) and
> [the interop bridge](#linux-vulkan-interop-bridge).

Mario Kart Wii VR Port is a native Windows VR port of Mario Kart Wii. It combines WiiCompiled's
static recompilation with a native OpenXR renderer and tracked-controller input. The game runs as
native x86-64 code; no Wii emulator, interpreter, JIT, or PowerPC CPU is used at runtime.

This repository distributes the VR port, its installer, and its build tools. It does not distribute
Nintendo code, game assets, a translated game executable, or a ROM. You must provide your own
clean PAL `RMCP01` disc image and compile the game locally.

## What the port adds

- Native OpenXR rendering through D3D12 with a desktop mirror and a safe desktop fallback.
- Three race cameras: the original game camera, a true first-person cockpit camera, and a distant
  diorama camera. The right-stick click cycles cameras during a race.
- A seated cockpit aligned to the driver's evaluated eye position. The driver is hidden in first
  person, and the view adapts to small, tall, and temporarily resized characters.
- Physical steering: grab the real kart wheel or motorcycle handlebar with either tracked hand.
  Native vehicle animation is enabled by default and can be disabled in VR settings.
- Two-hand steering with centre-crossing and brief tracking-loss tolerance, adaptive smoothing,
  full-turn hand continuity, and a left-stick fallback after both hands release the control.
- Tracked hands depth-tested against the kart and the track, with SteamVR controller models and
  per-controller button animations in the VR tutorials and menus.
- A left-hand race HUD with the circuit map and item panel. In first person, the HUD is anchored in
  front of the seat so it stays readable while the head moves.
- An anchored, spatial VR presentation for the camera chooser, VR settings, controller guides, and
  Mario Kart menus. The first launch offers a camera choice through a VR pointer.
- A first-race controller tutorial, plus a separate first-person tutorial. Both can be reset from
  VR settings.
- Configurable eye resolution, sharpness, refresh-rate preference, adaptive resolution, world scale,
  HUD placement, camera trim, steering response, grab assistance, deadzone, haptics, and diagnostics.
- Retro Rewind VR support through the integrated WheelWizard launcher.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- SteamVR installed and running. The VR executable selects SteamVR's OpenXR runtime for its process;
  start SteamVR and connect the headset before launching the game.
- A D3D12-capable GPU and a driver accepted by SteamVR, OpenXR, and Dawn. GTX 1650 / RX 6400 /
  Arc A310 or better is a practical starting point.
- About 20 GB free while installing and compiling. The compiled game is about 5 GB, excluding
  optional Retro Rewind files.
- Your own clean, unmodified PAL `RMCP01` disc image. ISO, GCM, GCZ, CISO, WBFS, WIA, and RVZ are
  accepted. Other regions and modified executables are rejected.

## Installation

### Guided installer

1. Download `WiiCompiled-Setup.exe` from the [v1.0 release](https://github.com/heurazy/mario-kart-wii-VR-port/releases/tag/v1.0).
2. Start SteamVR, then run the installer.
3. Select your clean PAL `RMCP01` image and choose an installation folder.
4. Leave **Download and install Retro Rewind automatically** enabled if you want both games.
5. Select **Install**. The setup translates and compiles the game on this PC; the image never leaves
   the computer.

The installer installs WheelWizard in the `WheelWizard` subfolder, creates a **Mario Kart Wii VR
Launcher** shortcut on the desktop and in the Start Menu, and opens the launcher when installation
finishes. Select **Mario Kart Wii VR** or **Retro Rewind VR** from that launcher.

### Portable bundle

Download `WiiCompiled-VR-Portable-v1.0.zip`, extract the complete folder, and run
`WiiCompiled-VR-Setup.exe`. Keep **portable installation** enabled and keep the folder together.
The launcher is at `WheelWizard/WheelWizard.exe`; the `UserData` folder keeps configuration, NAND,
cache, and logs beside the portable installation. `Update-VR.cmd` updates the VR runtime while
preserving personal and compiled game data.

No release contains a ROM or a translated game executable. Compilation is intentionally performed
locally from the disc image you select.

## Quest and OpenXR controls

The runtime uses standard OpenXR actions, so Quest 2, Quest 3, Touch Pro, Valve Index, PICO, Vive,
Windows Mixed Reality, Samsung Odyssey, and other advertised profiles use the same in-game actions.
Vive trackpads substitute for thumbsticks where necessary. The left menu/system button keeps its
headset function; on SteamVR it opens the SteamVR dashboard.

| Controller input | Original / diorama camera | First-person cockpit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left stick | Steer; navigate menus | Steer after releasing the wheel; navigate menus |
| Right trigger | Accelerate | Accelerate |
| Left trigger (hold) | Brake, then reverse | Brake, then reverse |
| A | Accelerate / confirm | Hop and drift / confirm |
| B | Brake / cancel | Brake / cancel |
| Y | Use or hold item | Use or hold item |
| X | Trick / motorcycle wheelie | Trick / motorcycle wheelie |
| Right stick directions | Directional tricks and wheelies | Directional tricks and wheelies |
| Left or right grip | Right grip hops/drifts | Grab the wheel or handlebar |
| Right stick click | Cycle the three VR cameras | Cycle the three VR cameras |
| Left menu/system button | Pause outside SteamVR | Pause outside SteamVR |
| X + Y | Open or close VR settings | Open or close VR settings |

On SteamVR, tap X for a trick. Hold X for about 0.65 seconds to send one Mario Kart pause press;
the SteamVR system/menu button remains available for the dashboard. X + Y always opens VR settings
without forwarding either button to the game. The left trigger always brakes and reverses, including
when the wheel is held.

In the cockpit, squeeze a grip near the wheel or handlebar to grab it. One or both hands can steer;
joining or releasing a hand preserves the current steering target. Releasing both grips returns
steering to the left stick. Open **VR settings > Driving** to change native wheel animation,
acquisition range, steering response, tracking-loss tolerance, and grab assistance.

## Cameras, HUD, and comfort

The first-launch VR panel asks for the default camera with a pointer and trigger. The choice is
saved and used at the beginning of every race. Races begin in the selected camera; the original
game camera is used for the short race-start launch animation and returns to the selected camera
when the animation ends or is skipped.

The original and diorama cameras show the race HUD, minimap, and item roulette on a panel that can
follow the left hand. First person anchors the same HUD in front of the seat. **VR settings >
Display** controls panel distance and width; **Camera** controls seat trim and world scale.

The physical wheel and camera are stabilised during impacts, spins, airborne tricks, and Lightning
scale changes. This keeps the view and hand controls attached to the kart without making the world
rotate with a damage animation. **Show control tutorials again** resets the first-race and
first-person guides.

## VR settings

Open VR settings with **X + Y** in the headset or **F10** on the desktop mirror. The menu includes:

- **Graphics:** per-eye resolution, sharp rendering, preferred headset refresh rate, FPS display,
  adaptive resolution, and menu shader quality (`Off`, `Low`, `Balanced`, `High`).
- **Camera and Display:** default camera, first-person head offsets, world scale, HUD width and
  distance, and seat reset.
- **Driving:** native steering-wheel animation, kart and motorcycle steering range, acquisition
  depth, grab assistance, smoothing, tracking-loss tolerance, and haptics.
- **Input:** controller profile diagnostics and stick deadzone calibration.
- **Tutorials and Diagnostics:** replay guides and export `VR-diagnostics.txt` beside `Config.toml`.

Changes are saved to `Config.toml`. Resolution and some refresh-rate changes take effect after a
restart; camera, HUD, steering, shader quality, and diagnostic options apply immediately.

## WheelWizard and Retro Rewind

WheelWizard is bundled as the launch and mod-selection front end. It has two local VR entries:

- **Mario Kart Wii VR**, using the base compiled game;
- **Retro Rewind VR**, using the separate Retro Rewind static profile.

The upstream WheelWizard updater is disabled for these local VR bundles so it cannot replace the
VR-specific launcher integration. Retro Rewind is optional during setup and requires its own local
compilation from the same clean PAL image.

## Troubleshooting

- **The headset stays on the desktop mirror:** start SteamVR first, check that it is the active
  OpenXR runtime, and restart the game. `required = false` falls back to desktop mode when OpenXR
  cannot create a session.
- **The game is not visible in WheelWizard:** run the copied setup from the installation folder,
  select the clean PAL `RMCP01` image, and let the local compilation finish.
- **The wheel is difficult to grab:** use **VR settings > Driving** to increase acquisition depth
  and grab assistance, then reset the seat position. Both grips can be used independently.
- **Tracking or performance problems:** lower eye resolution or menu shader quality, disable
  adaptive resolution if frame pacing is unstable, and export `VR-diagnostics.txt`.
- **Logs:** the runtime writes OpenXR and compilation diagnostics under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\WiiCompiled\\Logs` (or `UserData\\Logs` in a portable installation).

## Building from source

Building requires .NET 8, CMake, Ninja, LLVM-MinGW, and a clean PAL `RMCP01` image. The supported
release target is Windows/D3D12 with OpenXR enabled. The main build scripts are:

```powershell
dotnet build translator/Translator.sln -c Release
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Launcher/Build-Installer.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Launcher/Build-Portable.ps1 `
  -SetupExecutable Launcher/dist/WiiCompiled-Setup.exe -Version 1.0
```

The build boundary deliberately excludes translated game code and game data from Git and releases.
See [OPENXR.md](OPENXR.md) for the implementation details, configuration keys, controller profiles,
and validation notes.

## Building on Linux

The Linux VR build vendors a patched Dawn that exposes Aurora's native Vulkan handles
(`aurora-main/cmake/patches/dawn-vulkan-native-handles.patch` plus
`dawn-vulkan-openxr-instance-extensions.patch`) so the OpenXR backend can borrow Aurora's Vulkan
device, physical device, queue, and graphics queue family.

```bash
# enable the OpenXR renderer in the native configure step
Launcher/local-build.sh --output-dir ./out --openxr
```

A physical headset run is still required on the target hardware to verify controller tracking
recovery, camera placement, and minimap legibility.

## Linux/Vulkan interop bridge

Both platforms submit an acquired OpenXR swapchain image to Aurora's own graphics queue. On Linux
this goes through `aurora-main/lib/webgpu/vulkan_interop.cpp` and the C bridge in
`aurora-main/include/aurora/vulkan_interop.h`, so a stereo SinkFrame lands in the headset's
swapchain with zero CPU readback:

1. Aurora/OpenXR borrows the same `VkDevice` + `VkQueue` Dawn renders with.
2. **Phase A** (Dawn): the rendered eye target is copied into a shared Vulkan intermediate
   image whose memory is exported as an opaque FD and imported into Dawn
   (`dawn::native::vulkan::WrapVulkanImage`).
3. **Phase B** (native Vulkan): the same intermediate is copied into the OpenXR swapchain image
   on the shared queue, exactly as the D3D12 path advances its chain.

### The layout fix (dedicated allocation)

The headset originally showed grainy, tile-periodic vertical stripes (16-texel columns) while the
desktop mirror stayed clean. A same-frame, three-way capture isolation tool
(`MKW_VR_CAPTURE_INTERMEDIATE=1`, see below) proved Phase A was pixel-perfect (`coupled_eye_left`
was byte-identical to `coupled_intermediate_left`) while the native Vulkan readback of the *same*
memory (`coupled_intermediate_native_left`) was scrambled. The corruption was therefore a
cross-API image-layout disagreement, not broken pixels.

Dawn re-creates the imported image with a **dedicated allocation**
(`VkMemoryDedicatedAllocateInfo`, chosen via `prefersDedicatedAllocation`), which is when these
drivers select a swizzled/tiled layout. The native intermediate was previously bound with a plain
allocation, so the two images decoded the same memory with two different tilings. The fix was to
match Dawn on the native side:

- `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_ALIAS_BIT_KHR` on the native intermediate image, mirroring the flag Dawn forces
  onto its re-created import, and
- a **dedicated allocation** for the exported memory (`VkMemoryDedicatedAllocateInfo.image` on the
  native image), so both sides land on the same driver-picked swizzle.

With both sides aligned the headset picture is correct. The two Dawn patches under
`aurora-main/cmake/patches/` are applied by the CMake build (see `AuroraDawnProvider.cmake`).

### Capture diagnostics

Rebuild with the diagnostic armed by setting the environment variable once, and the first submitted
stereo frame writes three same-frame BMPs plus a status file beside the binary:

```bash
MKW_VR_CAPTURE_INTERMEDIATE=1 ./native-build/WiiCompiled
```

| File | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `coupled_eye_left.bmp` | the left eye target read back through Dawn (ground truth) |
| `coupled_intermediate_left.bmp` | the shared intermediate read back through Dawn |
| `coupled_intermediate_native_left.bmp` | the same shared memory read through the native Vulkan image (exactly what Phase B blits) |
| `coupled_capture_status.txt` | Dawn map status (`wait1/status1/wait2/status2`) — both `1` means both reads succeeded |

Byte-identical `coupled_eye` and `coupled_intermediate` with a scrambled `coupled_intermediate_native`
points at an interop layout mismatch (the bug fixed above); a scrambled `coupled_eye` itself means the
corruption originates in Aurora's eye render. The `*.bmp`/status outputs are git-ignored.
